# Documentation P4

* This project is build upon the previous game-staking branch, which contained a basic movment and pick up system. At this point of the project the old Plugin is being kept but will be changed in the next iteration of the milestones. Actuelly three milestones were planed for this iteration but because unnecessary things from the submodules will be removed the milestones for the dishwasher and oven will be done in the next iteration.

* If the debug mode in the Visual Studio editor is started one excaption happens, which can be irgnored with the started button, but should be mentioned here. ![](Img/Exception.PNG "Exception during debug start.")  

* Milestone 1 documentation can be found [here](Milestone1.md). This milestone is the realistic walking animation, where the character starts slowly and gets faster over time until the maximum speed is reached.   

* Milestone 2 documentation can be found [here](Milestone2.md). This milestone is for the rotation of the objects in the hands of the character. In this iteration a very basic roation is accomplished and will be refined in the next iteration.
