### Project description

Purpose of this project is to add relistic opening simulations to the Unreal
Environment. To fulfill this purpose we create a screw joint component, that
connects two StaticMeshes (a lid component and a container component) with each
other in a way that they can only be separated by rotating the lid among the
correct axis.

The plug in is as parameterized as possible, i.e. the user can decide how much
the lid needs to be turned to open the glass, as well as how much the lid
travels up and down on the Z axis while rotating, etc.

To add some realism, there is also an initial force that needs to be overcome,
simulating a tightly screwed on lid on a container.

### Milestones

* [Milestone1](Documentation/Milestone1.md)
* [Milestone2](Documentation/Milestone2.md)

### Documentation

* Documentation of the project of when it is **finalized**, written in the `Documentation/Documentation.md` file
* This should basically be a combination of all the milestone descriptions
* The above bulletpoints should obviously removed in the pull request, and replaced with something like: The documentation of the project can be found [here](Documentation/Documentation.md).

### Tutorial

* Documentation of the project of when it is **finalized**, written in the `Documentation/Tutorial.md` file
* Again combination of all the milestone tutorials
* The above bulletpoints should obviously removed in the pull request, and replaced with something like: Tutorials for testing the project can be found [here](Documentation/Tutorial.md).
